### Song Power System

Restore song power in animation.

<details> <summary>Obtain</summary>

**You need to have access to song abilities/`Ardoni Origin` to use `Song Stones`!**

There are chunks named `Song Chunk` in the world. Craft a `Song Stone` and when you in a song chunk, the color will
change.

Also, you can upgrade with `Notes` to detect specific song chunk. The color will half change if you near a song chunk
(default 2 chunks).

Ones you found a song chunk, you can place a note block and play it. It will drop `Notes`.

The count of `Notes` is 3-6. Ones all of them are dig out, the chunk is no longer a song chunk.

Finally, you can craft songs with `Notes`. Its power will randomize.

**The song chunk will regenerate with 1 note per day (Invoke at midnight/18000 ticks).**

</details>

<details> <summary>Usage</summary>

#### Admin command (Or single player)

`/sow power enable/disable <player>` to enable/disable access to song abilities.

#### Combine song cube

**Mod will also extract a schematic file, you can use it with `Litematica`**

Build a shrine structure below. Put song cube in the hole like how to do in Animation.
Then stand on the `chiseled stone bricks`, look at the song cube and sneak for 3s.

If everything is correct, the song cube will start spawning particles. After an explosion, the combination is completed.
